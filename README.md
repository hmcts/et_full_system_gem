# EtFullSystem

This gem is used to boot up all of the components of the Employment Tribunals system ready for testing or other purposes

## Installation

Because the gem is not yet published anywhere, it cannot be installed using the normal 'gem install' command, as it
only exists in github - only Bundler can install from github.
The full system test suite, which also checks out all 5 services into sub directories includes this gem, so once you have
done 'bundle install' from there - the gem will be installed, but you will need to prefix all commands with 'bundle exec' unless
you have produced a 'binstub' for this gem (see below) - then you can just use the executable directly.

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'et_full_system'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

And if you want to install a binstub (do bundle help binstubs for more options you might want)

    $ bundle binstubs et_full_system --standalone

Or install it yourself directly from github as follows:

    $ git checkout git@github.com:hmcts/et_full_system_gem.git
    $ cd et_full_system_gem
    $ gem build et_full_system -o et_full_system.gem
    $ gem install et_full_system.gem
    $ rm et_full_system.gem

## Usage

To setup and start the server with 1 command

    $ et_full_system docker server

To reset the server

    $ et_full_system docker server down -v

To setup and start the server in detached mode (i.e showing no logs etc..)

    $ et_full_system docker server -d

To watch the logs of an existing running server

    $ et_full_system docker compose logs -f

To do any other docker compose commands

    $ et_full_system docker compose <command> <command args>

### Upgrading

Note that docker caches stuff for the better and for the worse.  So, the command in the Dockerfile that installs the version
of the gem that you have - but inside docker - will be cached forever - only if the command changes in the Dockerfile is this
cache busted.

So, for now - until there is a more automated solution to this, whenever a new version of this gem is installed - simply re build
your docker image using the following command

    $ et_full_system docker compose build --no-cache

Which will re build it from scratch - then just use the gem as normal
